# Graphical implementation of RSA algorithm

This project provides graphical implementation of RSA algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
How it works:
#1. The program expects an integer value as a bit length to encrypt the message,This can be 1024,2048 etc. 
#2. Based on bit length,it calculates the parameter values i.e P,N,E,Q,PHI and D.
#3. All calculated values can be seen in UI.We can also hide these values by clicking on HIDE button.
#4. The program expect a string message which we want to encrypt.
#5. We need to click on send button to send the message.
#6.Alice will type a message and send it to Bob,The message will be encrypted with this algorithm with no of bits provided in step 1.
